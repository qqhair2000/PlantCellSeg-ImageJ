# PlantCellSeg-ImageJ

A modular and practical **ImageJ/Fiji pipeline** for segmenting *plant epidermal cells* from 3D confocal microscopy images.  
This workflow includes **optional preprocessing with SurfCut** to better handle curved tissues such as leaves, and uses **MorphoLibJ** for morphological segmentation.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔬 Designed for **plant epidermal tissue** (e.g., leaf surface)  
- 🧼 **SurfCut support (optional)** for surface flattening  
- 🧠 Morphological segmentation using **MorphoLibJ**  
- 📏 ROI extraction for quantitative shape analysis  
- 🔁 ImageJ macro-based, reproducible and extensible

## 🧪 Pipeline Overview

The pipeline processes 3D confocal image stacks of plant tissues with flexible preprocessing options.

### Processing Steps:

1. **Preprocessing (choose one):**  
   - *SurfCut2 Lite* – Surface projection extracting the outermost cell layer, ideal for curved tissues like domed leaves
     若葉片彎曲嚴重：建議選 SurfCut2 Lite（將曲面轉平面再投影，保留邊界清晰度）。
   - *Max Projection* – Z-stack converted to 2D by maximum intensity projection, suitable for relatively flat samples
     若葉片幾乎平整或已壓平：Max Projection 即可。
   - *None* – Skip preprocessing and segment directly on the current slice

2. **Denoising:** Despeckle + Gaussian blur  
3. **Segmentation:** Marker-controlled watershed (MorphoLibJ)  
4. **ROI Extraction:** Convert label map to vector ROIs  


💡 Upon starting the macro, a dropdown menu allows you to select the preprocessing method, adapting the pipeline to your sample type.

## Comparison between SurfCut and SurfCut2 Lite

This project integrates [SurfCut2 Lite](https://github.com/VergerLab/SurfCut2) as a preprocessing step to efficiently and automatically extract the epidermal layer signal from 3D confocal stacks.

### Why choose SurfCut2 Lite?

- **Original SurfCut** [SurfCut](https://github.com/sverger/SurfCut)
  Offers full parameter options and an interactive interface, suitable for in-depth exploration of surface extraction principles and parameter tuning. It is a valuable tool for academic research and method development.

- **SurfCut2 Lite**  
  A lightweight, interface-free version designed for seamless integration into automated ImageJ macro workflows. It greatly saves processing time and improves reproducibility, making it ideal for routine large-scale data analysis.

### Recommendations

- If you need flexible parameter adjustments and want to deeply understand the projection mechanism, the original SurfCut is recommended.  
- If you prioritize speed, automation, and workflow stability, SurfCut2 Lite is preferred.
